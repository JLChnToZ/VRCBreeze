# VRCBreeze
VRCBreeze allows you to create any bone move in the wind. Supports wind strength, direction and randomization!

# Instructions

### **Requires:** Modular Avatar

### **Instructions:**
1) Drag VRCBreeze.prefab inside your Avatar. Do not unpack it.

2) Assign "Head" bone

3) Assign any bone you would like to move around by wind in "Bone Objects"

4) Adjust every individual weight to your liking (Setting it to 0 will do nothing, so don't leave it as 0)

5) Adjust Wind Strength. I recommend enabling Gizmos to see how much it will bend. Weight is also affecting it.

6) Once you have setup all your bones, click "Apply VRCBreeze to Avatar". \n Generated animations can be found at Assets/VRCBreeze/Animations/Generated/ folder.

7) Click "Finish" or delete "VRC Hair Breeze Creator" component before uploading the Avatar.
